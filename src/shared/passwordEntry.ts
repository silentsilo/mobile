/**
 * Applies an edit to a password entry without dropping anything the edit did
 * not mention.
 *
 * An entry is stored as one sealed JSON object and synced whole: saving it
 * replaces the stored copy outright. So a build that does not know about a
 * field, because a newer version added it, must not rewrite an entry without
 * it. The user edits a password on the old laptop, and the TOTP secret they
 * added on the new one is gone, with no error and nothing to undo.
 *
 * Spreading rather than listing fields is what makes that impossible, and
 * this function exists so the rule has a name and a test. Never build a saved
 * entry field by field, and never run one through a schema that strips what
 * it does not recognise.
